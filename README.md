# ebiso
UEFI bootable ISO image creator

Primary intention of ebiso was to create simple bootable UEFI ISO image for ReaR https://github.com/rear/rear on SLES11.
 
 - currently supports only 8.3 file name convention (Joliet might follow in future)
 - no additional dependencies
 - released under GPL
 - currently under heavy testing ;-)
